    <h4>Pointers</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A pointer is a memory address (8 bytes) that holds an address of <i>something</i>.</li>
        <li><b>&x</b> is the syntax for the memory address of variable <b>x</b>.</li>
        <li><b>int * p;</b> is the syntax for declaring a new pointer <b>p</b> that points to integers.</li>
        <li><b>*p</b> is the syntax for dereferencing a pointer, that is, following it to its pointee.</li>
        <li>Setting a pointer equal to another pointer makes it point to the same location.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Dynamic Memory Allocation</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Allocate things with the <b>new</b> keyword.</li>
        <li>Deallocate things by providing the pointer to the <b>delete</b> keyword. This doesn't actually delete the pointer itself, but instead only deallocates the memory location it points to.</li>
        <li>Unlike Java, C++ doesn't have garbage collection, so if you don't deallocate what you've allocated, you'll open a memory hole.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Visibility</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the syntax <b>friend class x;</b> within a class' header file to allow other class <b>x</b> to access its private fields.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Common C++ Errors</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Seg Fault: Trying to access memory outside of that which has been allocated.</li>
        <li>Double Free: Trying to delete something that has already been deleted.</li>
    </ul>
