    <h1>Mechanics & Thermo</h1>

    <h4>Kinematics Equations</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>\(x(t)=\frac{1}{2}at^2+v_0t+x_0\) relates \(t\) and \(x\).</li>
        <li>\(v(t)=at+v_0\) relates \(t\) and \(v\).</li>
        <li>\(v(t)^2-{v_0}^2=2a(x(t)-x_0)\) relates \(x\) and \(v\).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Newton's Laws of Motion</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Every object continues in its state of uniform velocity (whether at rest or constant velocity) as long as no net force acts on it.</li>
        <li>The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration, \(\Sigma \vec{F}=m\vec{a}\). Newton's first law is actually just a special case of this, where \(\Sigma \vec{F}=0\) and thus \(\vec{a}=0\).</li>
        <li>If one object exerts a force on a second object, the second exerts back a force of equal magnitude in the opposite direction on the first. This can be expressed through the equation \(\vec{F}_{ab}=-\vec{F}_{ba}\) where the first subscript is the object on which the force is being exerted, while the second is the source.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Friction</h4>
    <p>Friction is present when two solid surfaces slide across each other. There are two types of friction\(\dots\)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Kinetic friction applies while objects are sliding and is calculated \(F_{k} = \mu_kF_N\), where \(\mu_k\) is a measured coefficient of kinetic friction, different for every pair of surfaces.</li>
        <li>Static friction applies while objects are at rest and is calculated \(F_{s} \leq \mu_sF_N\). In general, \(\mu_s > \mu_k\), meaning it is harder to get an object to start moving than it is to keep it moving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Newton's Law of Gravitation</h4>
    <p></p>
    \[F_{ab} = -G\frac{m_am_b}{{r_{ab}}^2}\]

    <h4>Kepler's Third Law</h4>
    <p>Kepler's Third Law tells us that for an orbiting object, \(T^2 \propto R^3\), where T is the time it takes to complete an orbit and R is the orbit radius. Thus, for two objects a and b, the ratios of their orbital periods and orbital radii are related like so.</p>
    \[ \left(\frac{T_a}{T_b}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{R_a}{R_b}\right)^3 \]

    <h4>Rotational Motion</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Angular velocity is the rate of change of the angle with time, \(\omega = \frac{d \theta}{dt}\).</li>
        <li>Linear velocity is defined \(v=\omega r\)</li>
        <li>Centripetal acceleration is defined \(a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}\)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Physical Measurements & Standard Units</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Length: meters, m</li>
        <li>Mass: kilograms, kg</li>
        <li>Time: seconds, s</li>
        <li>Force: Newtons, N (\(\text{m}\cdot\text{kg}/\text{s}^2\))</li>
        <li>Work: Joules, J (\(\text{N}\cdot\text{m}\))</li>
    </ul>
