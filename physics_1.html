    <h1>Mechanics & Thermo</h1>

    <h4>Kinematics Equations</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>\(x(t)=\frac{1}{2}at^2+v_0t+x_0\) relates \(t\) and \(x\).</li>
        <li>\(v(t)=at+v_0\) relates \(t\) and \(v\).</li>
        <li>\(v(t)^2-{v_0}^2=2a(x(t)-x_0)\) relates \(x\) and \(v\).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Newton's Laws of Motion</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Every object continues in its state of uniform velocity (whether at rest or constant velocity) as long as no net force acts on it.</li>
        <li>The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration, \(\Sigma \vec{F}=m\vec{a}\). Newton's first law is actually just a special case of this, where \(\Sigma \vec{F}=0\) and thus \(\vec{a}=0\).</li>
        <li>If one object exerts a force on a second object, the second exerts back a force of equal magnitude in the opposite direction on the first. This can be expressed through the equation \(\vec{F}_{ab}=-\vec{F}_{ba}\) where the first subscript is the object on which the force is being exerted, while the second is the source.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Friction</h4>
    <p>Friction is present when two solid surfaces slide across each other. There are two types of friction\(\dots\)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Kinetic friction applies while objects are sliding and is calculated \(F_{k} = \mu_kF_N\), where \(\mu_k\) is a measured coefficient of kinetic friction, different for every pair of surfaces.</li>
        <li>Static friction applies while objects are at rest and is calculated \(F_{s} \leq \mu_sF_N\). In general, \(\mu_s > \mu_k\), meaning it is harder to get an object to start moving than it is to keep it moving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Newton's Law of Gravitation</h4>
    <p></p>
    \[F_{ab} = -G\frac{m_am_b}{{r_{ab}}^2}\]

    <h4>Kepler's Third Law</h4>
    <p>Kepler's Third Law tells us that for an orbiting object, \(T^2 \propto R^3\), where T is the time it takes to complete an orbit and R is the orbit radius. Thus, for two objects a and b, the ratios of their orbital periods and orbital radii are related like so.</p>
    \[ \left(\frac{T_a}{T_b}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{R_a}{R_b}\right)^3 \]

    <h4>Rotational Motion</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Angular velocity is the derivative of the angle theta with respect to time, and is defined \(\omega = \frac{d \theta}{dt}=2\pi f=\frac{2\pi}{T}\).</li>
        <li>Linear velocity is defined \(v=\omega r\).</li>
        <li>Centripetal acceleration is defined \(a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}=\omega^2r\).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Kinetic Energy</h4>
    \[K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\]

    <h4>Gravitational Potential Energy</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>General definition of gravitational potential energy: \(\Delta U = -W_G=-\int_1^2F_G\cdot dl\)</li>
        <li>For any conservative force: \(\Delta U = U_2-U_1=-\int_1^2F\cdot dl = -W\)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Elastic Potential Energy</h4>
    <p>Elastic potential energy is used to describe when a spring is compressecd or streched.</p>
    \[F_S=-kx\]
    \[U=\frac{1}{2}kx^2\]
    \[\vec{F}=-\vec{\nabla} U\]

    <h4>Mechanical Energy</h4>
    <p>If all forces acting are conservative, the sum of the changes in kinetic and potential energy are zero, and thus  the total mechanical energy is constant and defined like so.</p>
    \[E=K+U\]

    <h4>Momentum</h4>
    <p>During a collision, the sum of the momentum of all objects involved does not change.</p>
    \[p=mv=\sqrt{2mK}\]
    <p>The change in an object momentum is referred to as impulse, and is defined like so, since the derivative of momentum with respect to time is the sum of the forces acting on an object.</p>
    \[\Delta p = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}F\,dt\]

    <h4>Angular Momentum</h4>
    \[L=I\omega\]

    <h4>Moments of Inertia</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>\(I_\text{point}=mr^2\)</li>
        <li>\(I_\text{cylinder}=\frac{1}{2}mr^2\)</li>
        <li>\(_\text{rod about end}=\frac{1}{3}mL^2\)</li>
        <li>\(I_\text{sphere}=\frac{2}{5}mr^2\)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Torque</h4>
    \[\tau=r\times F=rF\sin{\theta}=I\alpha\]

    <h4>Rotational Kinematics</h4>
    For these formulae to work, your \(\alpha\) and \(\omega\) should be in terms of \(\theta\) and \(s\), not \(\text{rpm}\)!
    <ul>
        <li>\(\omega(t)=\alpha t+\omega_0\)</li>
        <li>\(\omega(t)^2-{\omega_0}^2=2\alpha\theta\)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Parallel Axis Theorem</h4>
    States that inertia in a body is the equivalent to the sum of the inertia about the center and product of the mass of the body and the square of the distance between the two axes.
    \[I=I_c+Md^2\]

    <h4>Rotational Kinetic Energy</h4>
    \[ KE_{rot} = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2 \]

    <h4>Young's Modulus</h4>
    \[ E=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}=\frac{F/A}{\Delta L/L} \]

    <h4>Lift Force</h4>
    \[ F=\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2AC \]

    <h4>Harmonic Motion</h4>
    \[ \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \]
    \[ x(t) = A\cdot\sin(\omega t) \]

    <h4>Physical Measurements & Standard Units</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Length: meters, m</li>
        <li>Mass: kilograms, kg</li>
        <li>Time: seconds, s</li>
        <li>Force: Newtons, N (\(\text{m}\cdot\text{kg}/\text{s}^2\))</li>
        <li>Work: Joules, J (\(\text{N}\cdot\text{m}\))</li>
    </ul>
