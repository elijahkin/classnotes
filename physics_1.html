    <h1>Mechanics & Thermo</h1>

    <h4>Physical Measurements</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Length is measured in meters (m).</li>
        <li>Mass is measured in kilograms (kg). Mass is a measure of the inertia of an object, sometimes understand as the quantity of matter in the objects. Mass is <b>NOT</b> weight.</li>
        <li>Time is measured in seconds (s).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Kinematics Equations</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>\(x(t)=\frac{1}{2}at^2+v_0t+x_0\) relates \(t\) and \(x\).</li>
        <li>\(v(t)=at+v_0\) relates \(t\) and \(v\).</li>
        <li>\(v(t)^2-{v_0}^2=2a(x(t)-x_0)\) relates \(x\) and \(v\).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Other Kinematics Ideas</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>\(\bar{v}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\) and \(\bar{a}=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}\) denote average velocity and acceleration.</li>
        <li>\(v= \frac{dx}{dt}\) and \(a= \frac{dv}{dt}\) denote instantaneous velocity and acceleration.</li>
        <li>\(\bar{s}=\frac{\text{distance}}{\Delta t}\) denotes average speed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Forces</h4>
    <p>In simplist terms, a force is a push or pull, thus naturally, forces are vectors. The unit of force is called the Newton, where \(1 N = 1 kg \cdot \frac{1 m}{s^2}\).</p>

    <h4>Newton's Laws of Motion</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Every object continues in its state of uniform velocity as long as no net force acts on it.</li>
        <li>The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration, \(\Sigma \vec{F}=m\vec{a}\). Newton's first law is actually just a special case of this, where \(\Sigma \vec{F}=0\) and thus \(\vec{a}=0\).</li>
        <li>If one object exerts a force on a second object, the second exerts back a force of equal magnitude in the opposite direction on the first. This can be expressed through the equation \(\vec{F}_{ab}=-\vec{F}_{ba}\) where the first subscript is the object on which the force is being exerted, while the second is the source.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Weight</h4>
    <p>Weight is the force exerted on an object by gravity.</p>
    \[\vec{F}_G = -m\vec{g}\]
    <p>Near the surface of the earth, \(g=9.80 m/s^2\)</p>
