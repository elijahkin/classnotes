    <h1>Differential Equations</h1>

    <h4>What are differential equations?</h4>
    <p>A differential equation is any equation involving the derivatives of an unknown function, and its solution is the infinite family of functions that make the equation true. For example, given the differential equation\(\dots\)</p>
    \[ \frac{dy}{dx} = x^2 \]
    <p>\(\dots\)we can simply integrate both sides to find that\(\dots\)</p>
    \[ y = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C \]
    <p>This represents the general family of solutions that solve the differential equation, however if we were asked to find a specific solution given an initial condition, we would then have to solve for the specific value of \(C\).</p>
    <p>A differential equation's order refers to the highest derivative that it contains. For example, the differential equation we looked at above is order 1, however the one below is order 2 since it contains a second-derivative.</p>
    \[ \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 2\cos(2x)\]
    <p>The general solution to a differential equation will always contain an equal number of arbitrary constants as its order. This makes sense if we consider that in order to solve a given equation we would have to integrate a number of times equal to its order and each integration would introduce a new constant.</p>

    <h4>What are slope fields?</h4>
    <p>While many differential equations can be solved simply through integration, others pose more of a challenge and some are even impossible to solve analytically. However, there are several techniques to <i>approximate</i> solutions. Slope fields are one such way of (albeit very roughly) approximating solutions to differential equations.</p>

    <h4>What is Euler's method?</h4>
    <p>Euler's method is another, more analytic way of approximating differential equations. First, you must choose a step size, by which you'll repeatedly increment \(x\). Note that the closer your step size is to 0, the more accurate your approximation, but it will also be more tedious to compute. Suppose we are given the differential equation below and the accompanying inital condition.</p>
    \[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{3}xy \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; y(0) = 1 \]
    <p>You would start by making a table with three columns: \(x\), \(y\), and \(\frac{dy}{dx}\). Use the given initial condition to fill in the first \(x\) and the first \(y\) value. The rest of the \(x\) column can then be completed by repeatedly incrementing the initial value of \(x\) by the step size. In the example table below, a step size of 0.5 is used.</p>
    <p>Next, find the first value of \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) by evaluating the right hand side of the given differential equation with the first \(x\) and \(y\). Then add the product of that \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) value and the step size to the current \(y\) value to find the next \(y\) and continue finding and adding such products until the table is complete.</p>
    \[ \begin{array} {|r|r|}\hline x & y & \frac{dy}{dx} \\ \hline 0.0 & 1.000 & 0.000 \\ \hline 0.5 & 1.000 & 0.167 \\ \hline 1.0 & 1.083 & 0.361 \\ \hline 1.5 & 1.264 & 0.632 \\ \hline 2.0 & 1.580 & 1.053 \\ \hline  \end{array} \]
    <p>With this table, we can estimate the values of the solution to the original differential equation at various \(x\) values, for example, we would predict its value at \(x\) = 2 to be 1.580. However, in reality, its true value is \(e^{2/3}\) or approximately 1.947. Notice that our estimation is quite far from the true value. This is because our step size, 0.5, is quite large. If our step size were 0.01, we would have arrived at a much closer estimation of 1.938, but it would have also taken 50 times as many steps to arrive at our answer. Thus, when using Euler's method it is critical to weigh the importance of accuracy against that of efficiency.</p>
