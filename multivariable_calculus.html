    <h1>Multivariable Calculus</h1>

    <h4>Vectors</h4>
    <p>Vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction — think of them as arrows that point from
        the origin to a certain point in space. A vector's direction is literally the direction in which the arrow
        points, while
        its magnitude is the arrow's length. Vectors can have any number of dimensions (in this course though, we mostly
        deal with 2-D and 3-D vectors), and for each dimension, the vector has an associated number, called a component,
        that is, a 3-D vector has 3 components. Below, we the several varieties of vector notation.
    </p>
    \[ \vec{v} = \left\langle v_1, v_2, v_3 \right\rangle = v_1\hat{i} + v_2\hat{j} + v_3\hat{k}\]
    <p>The vector itself is represented by a letter with an over-arrow, while there are two methods of listing a
        vector's components. The first is to simply list out all the components within angle brackets, while the second
        is a bit
        more complicated, so we'll come to it later.</p>
    <p>A vector's magnitude is notated with vertical pipes and is computed
        by taking the square root of the sum of the square of each component. This equation can readily be derived from
        the distance formula.</p>
    \[ \lVert \vec{v} \rVert = \sqrt{{v_1}^2+{v_2}^2+{v_3}^2}\]
    <p>The term "unit vector" refers to vectors whose magnitudes are exactly 1 and have a special notation — instead of
        the over-arrow that most vectors have, unit vectors wear a hat, as in \(\hat{u}\).</p>
    <p>Vectors are added and subtracted component-wise, that is, corresponding components are added or subtracted to
            produce a resultant vector.</p>
        \[ \vec{v} \pm \vec{w} = \left\langle v_1 \pm w_1, v_2 \pm w_2, v_3 \pm w_3 \right\rangle\]

    <h4>Dot Product</h4>
    <p>The dot product is one way of multiplying two vectors and is sometimes called the scalar product because produces
        a
        scalar value. It is computed by adding the products of the corresponding components of the vectors.</p>
    \[ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = \left\langle v_1, v_2, v_3 \right\rangle \cdot \left\langle w_1, w_2, w_3 \right\rangle =
    v_1w_1 + v_2w_2 + v_3w_3\]

    <h4>Cross Product</h4>
    <p>The cross product is the other way of multiply two vectors and is also known as the vector product since it produces a vector.</p>
    \[ \vec{v} \times \vec{w} = \left\langle v_1, v_2, v_3 \right\rangle \times \left\langle w_1, w_2, w_3 \right\rangle
    = \left\langle v_2w_3-v_3w_2, v_3w_1 - v_1w_3, v_1w_2 - v_2w_1 \right\rangle\]

    <h4>Vector-Valued Functions</h4>
    <p>Vector valued functions are functions that take a single input (often time) whose outputs are vectors. These functions are particularly excellent for modeling the movement of a particle, since they output vectors that point to different points in space for every value of time.</p>
    \[ \vec{r}(t) = \left\langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \right\rangle \]

    <h4>Multivariable Functions</h4>
    <p>Below is an example of a three variable function.</p>
    \[ f(x, y, z) = \frac{5x}{(y+z)^2} \]

    <h4>Partial Derivatives</h4>
    <p>Partial derivatives are used to find the rate of change of multivariable functions along the Cartesian axes.
        Finding the partial derivative of a function with respect to a certain variable is largely the same as normal
        differentiation with the exception that any other variables should be treated as constants. There are two
        notations for partial derivatives, \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \) and \( f_x \). Both express the partial
        of \( f \) with respect to \( x \).</p>
    \[ f(x, y) = x^2y^3, f_x(x, y)= 2xy^3, f_y(x, y) = 3x^2y \]

    <h4>Tangent Planes</h4>
    <p>Partial derivatives can be used to approximate multivariable functions by creating a tangent plane about a
        point, much like regular derivatives can approximate single-variable function by creating a tangent line. The
        general equation for a plane tangent to \(f(x, y)\) at the point \((a, b)\) is below.</p>
    \[ z = f(a, b) + f_x(a, b)(x - a) + f_y(a, b)(y - b) \]

    <h4>Del Operator</h4>
    <p>The \( \nabla \) operator, pronounced del, is the vector differential operator and is used to find the gradient,
        divergence, and curl. The operator itself is a vector whose components are partial differential operators.
        Although it can be any number of dimensions, it's most commonly two or three.</p>
    \[ \nabla = \left\langle \frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
    \right\rangle \]

    <h4>Gradient</h4>
    <p>The gradient is essentially the derivative of a multivariable function and is found by multiplying \( \nabla \)
        with a multivariable function. Since the output of a multivariable function is a scalar and \( \nabla \) is a
        vector, the gradient is simply the vector whose components are the partials of the function.</p>
    \[ \nabla f(x, y, z) = \left\langle \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial
    f}{\partial z} \right\rangle \]
    <p>Once the gradient is found, it can be evaluated at any point simply by plugging in values for \( x \), \( y \),
        \( z \), etc. Interestingly, the vector produced by the gradient at any given point is said to point in the
        direction of maximum ascent, while its magnitude is the rate of increase in that direction.</p>

    <h4>Directional Derivatives</h4>
    <p>Although partial derivatives may be used to find the rate of change of a multivariable function along the
        Cartesian
        axes, directional derivatives must be used to find the rate of change in other directions. For any unit vector
        \(\hat{u}\), the rate of change of \(f(x, y, z)\) in that direction is found via the dot product of the
        gradient and \(\hat{u}\).
    </p>
    \[ D_{\hat{u}} f(x, y, z) = \nabla f(x, y, z) \cdot \hat{u}\]
